# Chatterbot!  The simplest AIML-based bot.

## I Built this on Ubuntu 19.04, but any linux should work

### Requires:
* You can build this in a virtualenv with python 2.7
* Here's a link to an article on virtual envs: https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/
* You should really familiar with virtual envs for programming
* I use Anaconda instead:  https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/
* If you want to go the Anaconda route, look here:  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-anaconda-on-ubuntu-18-04-quickstart

* use python 2.7
* pip
* Conda doesn't have aiml.  You can still use pip inside conda's env.  
* pip install aiml

### To run:
* In the project directory, type python -m chatter.py
* At the prompt say "hello"
* At the prompt say "who are you"
* Ctrl C to break

### Next steps:
* This simple example should help you understand a more difficult one.
* rename std-startup.xml to first-std-startup.xml
* rename better-std-startup.xml to std-startup.xml
* In the project directory, type python -m chatter.py
* Now you have a more sophisticated chatbot.
